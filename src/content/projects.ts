The main goal of DigiBirth is to increase knowledge about traumatic birth experiences and improve healthcare services for affected women. Currently, the available services and follow-up care are inadequate, and postpartum care faces numerous challenges.\n\nOur project, though independent from DigiBirth, shared the same objectives. It involved an extensive insight phase where we mapped pain points and areas for improvement in the Norwegian postpartum care. Additionally, we proposed a solution for integrating DigiBirth into a comprehensive follow-up system to better support and identify women in need of help after childbirth.`,

One of Laerdal’s key customers is medical education institutions who uses simulation products in medical training and assessment of students. Our project was related to how Laerdal can optimize their products for medical education in relation to EPA-based assessment.\n\nThroughout the project, we followed a strategic design process to create a proposal that aligned with Laerdal Medical’s goals.

I conducted a UX project exploring the possibilities of creating a holistic app experience for the customers of Circle K.\n\nCurrently, Circle K Europe provides three mobile applications.

I also produced a prototype of a potential combined experience.`,
