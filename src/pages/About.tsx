          Hi, I'm Lisa, a fifth-year Industrial Design student at NTNU. Throughout my studies, I have worked on
          projects in different fields of design with a focus on solving problems and creating the best possible user
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working across discovery and delivery: research, insights, service blueprints, flows, prototyping and
          communication. Below you'll find a selection of projects that reflect my interests in service design, UX and
          strategy.
